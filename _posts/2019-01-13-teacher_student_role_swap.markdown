I've been living and working the formal teacher role for 12 years.  What's it like to be on the other side of the teacher-student relationship?  What is computer programming?  What are jobs not in a school like? Could I enjoy a career without summer vacation?  Spring break #31 is coming up? Could I even consider a life without spring break?!?

There are many questions I have as I begin to learn computer programming and plan a career change.  This field fascinates me because most of us don't really know what it is even though it affects nearly every aspect of our lives.  As I learn more about it, I wonder how the things around us, and our own behaviors, are run by or significantly influenced by computer programs.  What is exciting is the potential for creating solutions to so many different types of problems. I look forward to better understanding what we can do with computer programming and what career doors open as I learn more.
